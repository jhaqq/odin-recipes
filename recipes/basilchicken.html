            &emsp;&emsp;This classic Thai dish was my favorite back in college.
             There was a restaurant a short walk from campus that got me absolutely hooked on the stuff.
             Holy Basil Chicken is a spicy, flavorful dish that is served over rice.
             It packs a ton of savory heat and I'm sure you'll love it as much as me if you give it a try!

        <p>&emsp;&emsp;This is my favorite recipe of all time. It is super spicy, so if you have a hard time with heat, I would opt for some less-spicy peppers. Thanks to <a href = "https://www.allrecipes.com/">AllRecipes</a> for the great recipe.</p>
