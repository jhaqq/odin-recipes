            &emsp;&emsp; This popular Chinese takeout dish is just as easy to order as it is to make yourself!
             The chicken is crispy and the sauce is second to none, bringing some tang and sweetness along with its deep orange color.
              This recipe is extremely customizable: I often opt for some broccoli and some additional garlic.
               People say that chicken and rice is boring, but that's only if you let it be! 
               I recommend adding this to your home menu if you're a fan of quick, delicious meals.
